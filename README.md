## Configure config.json file 📝
1. `MY_PRIVATE_KEY` (your wallet private key)
2. `RPC_ENDPOINT` (https RPC endpoint) paid services are faster
3. `RPC_WEBSOCKET` (websocket RPC endpoint) paid services are faster
4. `BUY_AMOUNT` (amount used to buy each new token)
5. `USE_SNIPEDLIST` (bot buy only tokens listed in snipedlist.txt)
6. `SNIPE_LIST_REFRESH_INTERVAL` (how often snipe list should be refreshed in milliseconds)
7. `MINT_IS_RENOUNCED` (bot buy only if mint is renounced)
8. `MIN_POOL_SIZE` (bot buy only if pool size is > of amount)
9. `MAX_POOL_SIZE` (bot buy only if pool size is < of amount)
10. `TAKE_PROFIT=80` (in %)
11. `STOP_LOSS=30` (in %)





## Auto Sell 📈
By default, auto sell is enabled. If you want to disable it, you need to:
1. Change variable `AUTO_SELL` to `false`
2. Update `MAX_SELL_RETRIES` to set the maximum number of retries for selling token
3. Update `AUTO_SELL_DELAY` to the number of milliseconds you want to wait before selling the token (this will sell the token after the specified delay. (+- RPC node speed)).

AUTO_SELL_DELAY to 0, token will be sold immediately after buy.
There is no guarantee that the token will be sold at a profit or even sold at all. The developer is not responsible for any losses incurred by using this feature.
